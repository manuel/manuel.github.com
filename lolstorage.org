Lolstorage is now at [[https://github.com/manuel/lolstorage]].  The text
below is of an older design.

---------------

* Description

/lolstorage/'s approach to P2P [[http://twitter.com][/social networking/]] and /content
sharing/ is to layer a /Git/-style model with /commits/ and
/trees-of-hashes/ (for representing histories of filesystem trees) on
top of a /cryptographic capability/ system inspired by [[http://tahoe-lafs.org/~zooko/lafs.pdf][/Tahoe-LAFS/]]
(for integrity and privacy of content even when stored on untrusted
providers). It runs in the browser in JavaScript and uses local
storage APIs.  Application data is stored as filesystem trees.  An
example Twitter-like app may store a user's tweets in a YYYY/MM/DD
directory structure.

The user's /wallet/ contains write-caps for the user's /refs/ (which
are mutable pointers to commits), and is encrypted with a
passphrase. The user may generate a read-cap for a ref and share it
with other peers. This read-cap allows the peers to locally /clone/
the state of the shared ref, which is similar to /following/ in
Twitter. The local clone can be updated efficiently, using similar
methods as those used in Git fetching and pushing. There is no shared
state; only a single user ever writes to a ref. Presented to users is
a locally computed /overlay/ of content from local and cloned remote
refs (e.g. a Twitter-like timeline) that may index the content to
provide services like search and sorted and aggregated views.

The resulting system is simple, secure, and disruption-tolerant
vaporware.

* Cryptography
These constructions are based on [[http://tahoe-lafs.org/~zooko/lafs.pdf][/Tahoe-LAFS/]].  I more or less
directly copied them, hoping to keep all of their security features
intact.  They are simpler because files are not split into
Reed-Solomon encoded shares.
** Objects

An immutable object is either a blob, a tree, or a commit.

Objects are encrypted using a fresh encryption key and stored under
the hash of their ciphertext.

The verify cap for an object contains the ciphertext hash, allowing
verification of stored content.

The read cap for an object contains the verify cap and the encryption
key, allowing decryption of stored content.

[[[lolstorage/diagrams/immutable.png]]

*** To write an immutable object
 * Generate encryption key
 * Encrypt data using encryption key
 * Create verify cap by hashing ciphertext
 * Write ciphertext to store using verify cap as storage index
 * Return immutable read cap containing verify cap and encryption key

*** To read an immutable object given a read cap
 * Read ciphertext from store using verify cap as storage index
 * Check that ciphertext hashes to verify cap
 * Decrypt ciphertext using encryption key

** Refs

A mutable ref "points to" the current commit: it contains an immutable
read cap for the commit.

For every mutable ref, a private-key pair is created.  The owner of
the ref has the private key, and thus can sign new versions of the
ref.

[[[lolstorage/diagrams/mutable.png]]

*** To write a mutable ref
 * Create read key by hashing private key
 * Generate salt
 * Create encryption key by hashing salt and read key
 * Encrypt ref value using encryption key
 * Sign ciphertext and salt using private key
 * Create content from ciphertext, salt, signature, and public key
 * Create verify cap by hashing public key
 * Write content to store using verify cap as storage index
 * Return mutable read cap containing verify cap and read key

*** To read a mutable ref given a mutable read cap
 * Read ciphertext, salt, signature, and public key from store
   using verify cap as storage index
 * Check that public key hashes to verify cap
 * Verify signature of salt and ciphertext using public key
 * Create encryption key from salt and read key
 * Decrypt ciphertext using encryption key

* Storage
All binary data is encoded using [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#URL_applications]["modified Base64 for URL"]] encoding,
with "-" and "_" as additional characters beyond [A-Z][a-z][0-9], and
requiring no trailing padding characters.

Some data may contain [[http://cr.yp.to/proto/netstrings.txt][netstrings]] for additional structure.  A
/netlist/ is a netstring containing further netstrings as components.
** Capabilities

*** Verify Caps

Base64-encoded binary data.

*** Read Caps

Read capabilities are two-component netlists, containing the verify
cap and the Base64-encoded encryption key or read key, depending on
type of read cap (immutable or mutable, respectively).

*** Private Keys

Base64-encoded binary data.
** Objects
*** Blob

Base64-encoded blob data.

*** Tree

A /dentry/ is a netlist =(name read-cap)=.

A tree is a netlist of dentries.

*** Commit

A /name/value pair/ is a netlist =(name value)=.

A commit is a netlist containing name/value pairs:

 * name: "parents", value: a netlist of read caps (typically
   containing just one but defined as a list for conceptual
   compatibility with Git)
 * name: "tree", value: read cap

** Refs
A mutable ref stored on the server has media type "text/html".

It contains the mutable ref content (a netlist with the Base64-encoded
components ciphertext, salt, signature, public key) as a CDATA section
in a HTML element with ID "x-lolstorage-storage-object".

In addition it may include JavaScript code that launches a user
interface for viewing the ref.

* Server Protocol
** Capability URLs

Immutable objects and refs are stored on plain HTTPS servers.

The capability URL for an immutable read cap is:

=https://server/path/to/verify-cap.html#encryption-key=

The capability URL for a mutable read cap is:

=https://server/path/to/verify-cap.html#read-key=

It's important that the verify cap is the last element of the path, so
it can be mechanically extracted from the URL.

The encryption and read keys are present in the URLs after the sharp
sign fragment identifier, and thus are not sent to servers over HTTPS.

*** Alternate Servers

It is possible to list alternate storage servers in an URL.

This example URL includes the alternate server
=https://otherserver/otherpath= with the URL parameter "alternate1":

=https://server/path/to/verify-cap.html?alternate1=https%3A%2F%2Fotherserver%2Fotherpath#read-key=

The verify cap will be appended to alternate server, giving the
alternate capability:

=https://otherserver/otherpath/verify-cap.html#read-key=

Additional servers can be listed with alternate2, alternate3, ...

** GET /path/verify-cap.html

** POST /path/verify-cap.html
